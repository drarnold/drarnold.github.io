Heyo there! I'm Drew Arnold.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p> I am currently employed as a DevOps Engineer at <a href="https://www.logicgate.com/"> LogicGate, Inc.</a>.</p><p> I have been currently working on some cool projects that involve AWS Lambdas, Terraform, Docker, and Jenkins.  My professional passions are Chaos Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering, DevOps Culture, and Observability.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf --><p> I have a pretty diverse engineering background.  I majored in Industrial Engineering at the University of Iowa with a focus in Simulation and Analytics.  Once I graduated from Iowa, I started my engineering career at Rockwell Collins as an Industrial Engineer focusing on Continuous Improvement and Lean Six Sigma.</p><p> After several years, I wanted challenge myself academically and professionally, so I decided to move back to the Chicagoland area where I obtained my Master's Degree in Engineering Management from Northwestern University while starting a new position as a Manufacturing Engineer at Honeywell Analytics.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf --><p> After doing some coding at Honeywell Analytics, I found myself wanting to learn more about the field of software engineering.  This led me to pursue a new career in technology where I found a Team Lead position on ther Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Team at Enova Financial.</p><p>I started on the manager path, but found out that my passion was in technology, so I shifted from Team Lead to Technical Lead of the SRE Team. After becoming a Tech Lead, I was able to obtain an AWS Solution Architect Certification.  I was then internally shifted over to the Observability Team at Enova to help improve our Observability stack to allow for better insights into our applications.  Once I was on the Observability Team for a while, I wanted to continue to expand my DevOps knowledge, so I found the position at LogicGate.</p><!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj --><p> If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to contact me via any of the following methods.<br> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-arnold-27884933/">LinkedIn</a> <br> <a href="https://github.com/drarnold">GitHub</a> <br> <a href="mailto: drew.r.arnold@gmail.com">Email</a></p><p>Cheers!</p><p>Drew</p>
